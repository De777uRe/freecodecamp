                                            where his brother had enrolled 3 years prior. The school is closed not long afterward due to
                                            a lack of pupils, and the headmaster Robert "Oldie" Capron was committed to a psychiatric hospital.
                                            Attends Campbell College in East Belfast, but leaves after a few months due to respiratory problems.
                                            Sent to the health-resort town of Malvern, Worcestershire, where he attends the preparatory school 
                                            Cherbourg House. During this time abandons his childhood Christian faith, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.</li>

                                            both of their families. He will go on to keep this promise and live with Paddy's mother Janie King Moore until she is hospitalized

                                            Yeats is among the men I have met: perhaps his appeal is purely Irish - if so, then thank the gods that

            <p id="closing-quote"><em>"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must
                give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all engtanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or
                coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable,
                irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."

                -- C.S. Lewis</em>
